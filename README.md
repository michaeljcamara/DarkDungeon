This is a prototype game using the Unity engine.  My goal was to familiarize myself with this engine, incorporating as many components as I could, such as: lighting, audio, particle effects, Mecanim state machines, animation sequences, basic physics and AI.  By making this small vertical slice of a game, I was able to greatly improve my understanding of Unity, which provided a foundation for my subsequent professional work.
