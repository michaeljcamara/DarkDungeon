This was my first attempt at making a functional game using the Unity engine.  My goal was to familiarize myself with this engine, incorporating as many components as I could, such as: lighting, audio, UI, particle effects, Mecanim state machines, animation sequences, basic physics and AI.  By making this small vertical slice of a game, I was able to greatly improve my understanding of Unity, which provided a foundation for my subsequent professional work.

To simply play the game, you can download the `Standalone_Executable.zip` file, extract the contents, and then run the `DarkDungeon.exe` file using the highest possible graphical setting ("Fantastic").  Note: the `DarkDungeon_Data` folder must be located in the same directory as the executable in order to work.

#Controls:

Movement: `W``A``S``D`

Interact/Grab/Attack: `Left-Click`

Jump: `Space`

Run: `Shift`

(If you are not sure what to do in the beginning, try knocking down the bottles on the table using the ball in front of you; the rest should be pretty self explanatory)
